     * When the agent pod is being deleted, Kubernetes calls the prestop hook configured.
     * The prestop hook script configured for agent container enables maintenance mode on the agent,
     * and waits for the number of workers in use to go to 0, before the pod gets terminated.
     * <p>
     * Whenever the scheduler calls this `apply` method, the following conditions are checked, and
     * corresponding actions are executed.
     * <p>
     * - If the pod has a label `preStopHookTermination: true`, do nothing and exit, as the pod is being
     * terminated, waiting for the prestop hook script to complete (that is, last running process on the agent
     * container to complete).
     * <p>
     * - Otherwise if the pod is in `RUNNING` phase, call the kubernetes client `delete` method on the agent pod,
     * which will put the pod in `Terminating` state and start executing the prestop hook script on the
     * agent container. Add the label `preStopHookTermination: true` (this will be checked on
     * subsequent executions).
