# Concord UI

Uses https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/ as the boilerplate.    

## Prerequisites

- Node 20 or greater, available in `$PATH`;
- Java 17, available in `$PATH`. Necessary only to build the package.

## Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies for the first time:
```bash
$ npm ci
```

To update `package-lock.json` run
```bash
$ ../mvnw clean package # only for the first run
$ ../mvnw com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin:npm -Darguments=install
```

## Running in Dev Mode

In the dev mode the UI is served by running `npm start`.

First time:
```bash
$ npm ci
$ npm start
```

The browser should automatically open on http://localhost:3000
(the initial load might take a while, especially on slower machines).

The `ci` step can be skipped for subsequent runs.

The dev mode has the following limitations:
- file download (e.g. downloading raw logs) doesn't work;
- [custom forms](https://concord.walmartlabs.com/docs/getting-started/forms.html#custom) don't work.

In order to use those features, you need to run the UI in production
mode (see below).

## Running in Production Mode

In the production mode the UI is served by concord-server from the JAR file
created during concord-console2 [build](./pom.xml).

When running locally, it is available at http://localhost:8001.

## Configuration

Specify the path to the `cfg.js` file when you start
[the Server](../server/dist):

```
CONSOLE_CFG_FILE=/path/to/cfg.js
```

or using concord-server.conf:

```
concord-server {
  console {
     cfgFile = "/path/to/cfg.js"
  }
}
```

Use [./public/cfg.js](./public/cfg.js) as an example.

## Custom Server URL

The `proxy` property in the [package.json](./package.json) file is used to
proxy API requests to the server. It can be used to point the UI in dev mode to
another server.
