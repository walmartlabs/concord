/**
 * This annotation can be used to prevent task arguments values from
 * being recorded in process events.
 * <p>
 * Currently, it is applicable only for task methods called directly
 * via expressions. For example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * flows:
 *   default:
 *     - "${crypto.exportAsString('myOrg', 'mySecret', 'mySecretPassword')}"
 * }</pre>
 * Assuming the task method has the third argument annotated with
 * {@link SensitiveData}, running this flow will result with
 * the third argument's value being masked in process events.
